## Minutes

 - UNC Neuro Microscopy Core
   - New microscope coming
   - New OMERO license(?)
 - Docker-compose project demonstrating using NFSRODS for /OMERO
   - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_imaging/tree/main/sandbox
 - Work in progress to show registering NFSRODS files into OMERO
   - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_imaging/issues/18
   - Might actually be the 'new normal' / 'best' way to do this
   - 'Just' requires correct permissions, we think
   - Rather than what is done today:
     - OMERO.insight used to 'import' via network drive (making a copy)
     - Or
     - Batch import / inplace (not a copy, but requires more moving parts)
 - Now that the OMERO object is not pointing at the actual iRODS data object in the iRODS Catalog...
   - syncing the events and metadata becomes... trickier?
 - Possible that image deposition in iRODS can automatically trigger 'inplace' import for the researcher
 - HALO - has its own database/system for metadata
   - Use case - wouldn't it be nice if all of these play well together
     - can see others' metadata / also... export/package all together / bundle... perhaps NGFF.
 - Ken: BioImaging UK breakout, data node UK working group
   - UK funding agency receptive to proposal for a data node
   - Brainstorming stage, no clear timeline yet
 - Next Meeting
   - Dec 2022
