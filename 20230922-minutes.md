## Minutes

 - BISQUE
   - https://bioimage.ucsb.edu/bisque 
   - Fetching of remote files
   - Lots of caching
   - Bisque-specific metadata is kept in bisque
   - UUID-tied to bisque is kept in iRODS AVU
   - Uploads to bisque go into the users' irods bisque_data collection
   - One bisque object is one physical file / iRODS object
 - OMERO
   - One omero object can point to multiple files
   - would / could also use an internal format (bioformat-based) like bisque
   - Largely has been assuming no duplication of files, and relatively small datasets
     - Fits on a single disk
 - STUFF WE TRIED/DID
   - Planning to parse some XML of OMERO objects
     - Parse to interesting AVU strings
     - Send to iRODS
   - conda install -c ome bftools
   - showinf -nopix -omexml-only a.fake
 - USE CASES
   - A) Analysis in OMERO - read-only(?) from a data store (iRODS/S3/others)
     - Teach iRODS how to register/send info into OMERO brain
     - Synchronization of any work back into iRODS brain
   - B) Upload to OMERO - would write to iRODS (no multiple copies of big files, and abstracts the storage to different backends / locations)
   - C) Annotation in OMERO - perhaps save/write metadata into iRODS (for visibility)
   - D) Annotation in iRODS - metadata visible in OMERO?
   - E) Teach iRODS how to push things to OMERO
   - Bisque does A and C?   Just A?
   - Everyone here wants A through D, equally.
     - Reading and writing are both important
 - Possible serialization of OMERO object information
   - Just write it down as a file - usually for an individual user
   - No new code, just 'export/serialize' into iRODS
   - Perhaps an AVU or two for identification / lookup
   - Philosophical Breakthrough may be thinking/defining this as a 'snapshot'
   - AA) 'OMERO-transfer'
     - Creates a tree of files
       - Metadata files at the top
       - Tree structure matches the originals in OMERO
     - Pack, send everything, perhaps tarred/zipped
     - Disaster recovery
     - Migration to a different OMERO
   - BB) 'unpack' from iRODS back to OMERO
     - Reconstitute a serialization

 - https://github.com/ome/omero-cli-transfer/blob/main/test/data/valid_single_dataset.zip
 - Lots of links
   - https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/fbi-data/fbi-omero 
   - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_imaging/blob/main/sandbox/docker-compose.yml 
   - https://github.com/ome/omero-cli-transfer/blob/main/src/generate_xml.py 
   - https://github.com/cyverse/irodsfs 
   - Proxying… (like sudo)
   - https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient#simple-puts-and-gets (parallel)
   - https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient#reading-and-writing-files (stream)
   - https://superfastpython.com/multithreaded-zip-files/ 
   - https://www.libarchive.org/ 
 - Script in OMERO
   - OMERO possibly stores user’s name in their account (but some mapping)
   - User has access to script and run `pip install omero-cli-transfer irodsclient`
     - moore->omero
     - Jackson lab - Dr. Erick Martins Ratamero -> omero
       - https://erickmartins.github.io/ 
   - User clicks on something/button/export/sendtoirods
     - Maybe no form to fill in (username/target/etc)
   - This runs `omero transfer pack –server-side some.zip`
   - Script copies some.zip to target location
   - Then iRODS perhaps runs any policy to expand/permission/extractAVUs
 - Future work to have it NOT be a direct injection, but rather go through an agent?
   - Agent would have admin permissions in 'both' directions
   - Easier to keep all omero/irods related code in lock-step
 - Separate effort
   - F) user migrating to different OMERO
   - 'PULL' back zip files from iRODS
   - Hydrate into the OMERO side of things
 - Alternate alternate possible future
   - No NFSRODS anymore
   - ONLY transfer in and transfer out w/ metadata capabilities
   - Just let OMERO do OMERO things with local install
 - Next Meeting:
   - Oct 19
