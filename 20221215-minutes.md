## Minutes

 - Pascal: have iRODS at Groningen. Previously used OMERO.
 - Terrell: docker project (from last time) used an iRODS vault for storing OMERO
   - A second part is a sync agent which tells the "other" API what's happening.
   - All the version logic, etc. living in one place ("Super Plugin")
   - Surprising thing is that the filesystem takes _2_ things.
   - Performance is still unknown.
   - Conversation shifted to registering NFSRODS files in OMERO.
     - register := "inplace import"
   - A bit skeptical that it "just worked"
   - Tl;dr – no blockers, only need more features.
   - Jan: will spin that up at NKI
 - Next steps
   - Import some scripts on the OMERO side to poke at the iRODS API
   - Then eventually, working prototypes get morphed/imported into a new agent that sits in the middle with two new API surfaces… each facing one direction
 - Valeria - command line inplace imports - multiple instances
   - Currently, admin does inplace imports… rather than the scientists themselves
   - Institutional support from IT, and now people are showing up(!)
   - Users cannot do an inplace import, because they're somewhere else different from the OMERO server (not visible)...
   - Can iRODS help with this - distributed data is distributed
     - a) Scientists inplace imports to OMERO, and then iRODS can replicate to keep another 'copy' under management, can happen in the background / at night.
     - b) iRODS gets it from the microscopes in the first place - then some metadata to make it 'appear' in OMERO
   - Goal - inplace is the goal, no duplication of files
 - Gap in OMERO today - OMERO has to have local access for inplace imports
 - Multiuser - There is some user mapping/retention that needs to be collected/recorded/remembered - authn/authz an open discussion/exercise
   - OMERO users are AD/LDAP, which also grants/controls access rights
   - But OMERO not currently a SSO… still one off at this time.
   - Alternatively, it's a Windows user… and the same UID could be reused.
 - UC1 - Michelle: OMERO touches save button -> writes to iRODS
   - Step A: copy previous script (have to find it) into docker environment
 - UC2 - Valeria: iRODS can register existing iRODS data as a particular OMERO user
   - Rule to invoke `omero import –transfer=ln_s` when new files are created.
 - Next Meeting
   - Jan 19th 2022
