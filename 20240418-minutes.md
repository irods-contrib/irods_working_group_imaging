## Minutes

 - Serialization of OMERO to (and from!) iRODS via PRC
 - Save/Export
   - No new work
   - Need to support an admin-defined/managed mapping file for use with 'as_user'
   - Current OMERO user -> iRODS user
 - Load/Import
   - No new work
   - Terrell and Josh - before/during ISC2024 in May
 - AbsorbRawFile
   - No new work
   - Josh: `omero import` rather than `omero transfer`
 - Nirav - Geo formats have proven well-behaved and bio formats starting to settle as well
   - For imaging, Bioformats are well-integrated into tooling...
     - But we need to look into the future in which the OME-Zarr format will become prevalent
     - Starting to require cloud-native formats (real soon)
     - We should make design choices knowing this will be normal/boring
     - Byte-range fetching available through iRODS HTTP API
       - Thinking of pulling that into iRODS server proper
 - Testing
   - OMERO first
     - Goal is a roundtrip for a file from OMERO<->iRODS
   - iRODS first
     - Goal is to 'import' into OMERO and see things 'just work'
 - Possible Jackson Lab connection/contact: Erick Ratamero
   - They originally developed cli-transfer in OMERO
 - Guillaume repository/project
   - https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/fbi-data/omero-quay 
 - Encryption
   - Hospital use cases will need to provide this type of solution soon
   - Go-commands now allow for encrypted filestreams into/out of iRODS
     - Encrypted at rest on disk
     - https://github.com/cyverse/gocommands?#encryption 
 - Next Meeting
   - June 2024
