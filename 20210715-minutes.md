## Minutes

 - Introductions
 - Use Cases
   - Josh Moore - heard about existing iRODS with Yoda, publishing into OMERO (as understood from Jeanne Wilbrandt. "Capture images in iRODS with some representation of the metadata and then choose from that collection to be moved to OMERO"). 
   - Marjolijn: iRODS user (pilot project) who would like to use OMERO to see the data and run processing & analysis scripts.
   - Michelle: OMERO pilot institutionally / iRODS institutionally
   - RIKEN: using OMERO today [https://ssbd.riken.jp/](https://ssbd.riken.jp/), iRODS in Proof of Concept
   - Susanne: using OMERO for a while, iRODS in Proof of Concept
   - Caterina: We have OMERO running in our department. We would love to have an integrated data management system that would include omics data and that would integrate with OMERO. For imaging we would like to OMERO centric. For other data iRODS centric.
 - Discussion
   - Investigate existing ImageJ work (tool for image manipulation/analysis)
     - http://neuroinformatics.be/projects/irods-client-for-imagej/
   - Other imaging RDM tools to be aware of… from OMERO survey
     - [Bisque/CyVerse](https://cyverse.org/bisque-image-analysis)
     - [CATMAID](https://catmaid.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
     - [Cytomine](https://cytomine.be)
     - Pathology: www.slidescore.com  (Cytomine is also used a lot for digital pathology)
   - Kafka
     - Other options? Terrell: have thought about a change-log WG
     - Something like RabbitMQ doesn't scale as well in throughput, but it should be easier to use and deploy
   - Resources
     - Possible developer time from group (UMass, Maastricht)
   - Possible alternate OMERO->iRODS approach
     - Just an OMERO plugin/integrator and via Jargon/Java -> iRODS API
     - Challenges: How to capture metadata in OMERO
   - Josh: OMERO has an "EventLog" which tells you things happened and those are grouped into Events to say what all changed in one transaction.
     - Mike: more information on OMERO’s EventLog would be useful
   - Paul: anyone tried putting OMERO ManagedRepository on NFSRODS?
     - Not yet, this is probably one of the first things we test/try
   - Michelle: mapping of e.g. a generated Figure might be useful (though tricky)
     - "Published" as a tag to find data
   - List of important OMERO things to send to iRODS
     - User annotations
     - Analysis runs/annotations
   - Thought experiment...
     - Omero client -> sends information to iRODS directly via Jargon/API
     - Would require OMERO-side development work / plugin
   - Alternate possibility for omero export of metadata
     - To a file (similar to current thinking for NGFF)

   - Next Meeting
     - In two months, September 2021, calendar invite to be sent
