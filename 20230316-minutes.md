## Minutes

 - iRODS UGM 2023 call for proposals now open
 - Technical Discussion
   - NFSRODS integration
     - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_imaging/issues/18
   - Planning to work alongside / in concert with S3 bucket support for iRODS
     - https://github.com/irods/irods_client_s3_cpp 
     - Does OMERO know how to talk to S3 / buckets?
       - Josh: Most imaging formats are not performant/good from S3
   - Nirav: CyVerse has caching layer between applications and iRODS backend
     - Cloud optimized formats is the future
     - Cotar (cloud optimized tar) - https://github.com/linz/cotar 
     - Stream-optimized zip
   - Guillaume working on new local filesystem interface, independent client
     - https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/fbi-data/small-and-various-pieces-of-coding/omero-shipping/-/blob/main/docs/message_flows.svg 
     - Microscope saves locally/buffer (cache server)
       - Nirav: CyVerse does similar - also compresses locally, generates checksums, user/ownership mapping from source to iRODS, lets imaging system know to gather metadata for the pipeline, via message bus
         - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1apz619gpqeRkxWMnjJ8M9PmYoIKCJthrNIMIky02VqI/edit#slide=id.g1cfa5a00840_0_163 
       - Jan: same pattern at NKI as well
     - User determines ready to import a particular dataset to OMERO
     - Data is moved into iRODS pre-determined location, then imported inplace
     - Then safely removed from the local buffer
 - Rodrigo: Next week we will have a meeting with SURF + Maastricht
   - Will discuss running iRODS/OMERO for the whole of the Netherlands
 - Judith: report up to Digital Research Alliance in Canada https://alliancecan.ca/en
   - Hoping for additional interest/support
 - Next Meeting
   - April 2023
