     - Austin, TX
 - France Bioimaging - NFSRODS integration
   - Sprint last week, working on cycles and IO
   - Direction is clear - no problems found with NFSRODS mount - so far…
     - If data is "inplace import"-ed directly into OMERO volume, cannot be seen by iRODS b/c lack of symbolic links
     - Solution - data is in OMERO and 'mapped' to iRODS, then no symbolic links needed
     - Agent possibly could detect a symbolic link and then update OMERO table
   - Working on plan for client to import data into iRODS/OMERO
   - Looking at Samba drives to microscope
     - then a web app to direct/ingest that location into iRODS/OMERO
   - Goal is an automated message queue system to populate import process
   - On Openstack instances by May, with goal of easy to deploy for others
     - Via Terraform for orchestration
   - Caterina - interested in the French efforts and combining the effort at FB with work on automated image import and metadata annotation that is happening at Canada Bioimaging - but not happening yet
     - https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/W-IDM_OmeroImporter 
   - Nirav - performance - is it fast/usable?
     - Not yet benchmarked, perhaps before June
     - Have done Bisque integration in the past - w/ bidirectional updates
       - Cache invalidation issue, but live shared filesystem was too slow
     - Offering UArizona Openstack infrastructure for testing/experiments
       - https://cyverse.org/cacao 
       - Also interest from Digital Research Alliance of Canada (DRAC)
         - https://alliancecan.ca/en 
       - Will look at getting started / copy/paste templates
 - Presentation of Canada Bioimaging potential OMERO / iRODS use case
   - https://www.canadabioimaging.org/ 
   - https://omero.med.ualberta.ca/index/ 
   - Current tooling to import metadata files pointing to local drive to OMERO server
     - Running during cron (nightly) from a folder
     - Being tested now in Canada instance
   - Plan is to have multiple sites in canada producing data to be imported
     - Issue: probably/possibly with multiple differences in different locations
     - Can iRODS maybe help with this?
   - Nirav - cache layer will be key, but have to deal with any updates / refreshing
     - And messaging bus to protect from overwhelming demand
   - Human scale - proven process/tool
     - https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/davrods 
   - Gocommands - easily deployable, similar to icommands
     - https://github.com/cyverse/gocommands 
   - Data standardization is top of mind, can iRODS help with that?
     - Yes, but iRODS does not have the tooling itself
     - Can automate existing workflows to fire at specific/determined times
     - The Consortium can house this type of tooling once developed
     - Nirav
       - iRODS can detect file type, info type, metadata coverage
       - Potentially automate transformations
 - A good practice has been to consider pipelining / handoffs between multiple steps
   - Clearly define the inputs and outputs of each
   - Allows for different technologies to be part of each step
 - Next Meeting
   - Mar 2023
