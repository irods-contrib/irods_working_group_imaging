## Minutes

 - IntegrationExercise1 - iRODS S3 API
   - Have created sandbox_s3
   - Any S3-ready application can talk to iRODS via S3 API
   - Next step:  Josh adds https://github.com/glencoesoftware/omero-zarr-pixel-buffer   to the sandbox, an OMERO-server-side read-only plugin
   - Flow can be
     - Data lands in iRODS (from instrument, script, etc.)
     - iRODS converts/etcâ€¦(if necessary, could already be OME-Zarr)
     - iRODS pushes XML to OMERO
     - OMERO should then see the images in 'S3' via iRODS S3 API
 - IntegrationExercise2 - Java FileSystemProvider class to talk to iRODS
   - Any Java application can talk to iRODS via 'local' filesystem calls
     - vs https://github.com/irods/irods4j
   - Example usage:
     - https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw/blob/master/src/main/java/com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw/Converter.java#L1220 
   - Compelling for NKI, perhaps in near-future development / application
 - RSpace recently produced PyFileSystem for RSpace
   - iRODS has dabbled with that as well in PRC
 - Next Meeting
   - After UGM
