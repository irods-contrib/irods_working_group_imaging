## Minutes

 - Terrell confirmed access to UNC/Odum OMERO (sand-box) server
   - Need to test user scripts and firewall to NeuroZone
 - Possible alternate mapping into iRODS/NFSRODS
   - To get around the single author/owner on the OMERO side
   - Possibly have to trust the OMERO claim (not ideal)
   - Currently UNC using LDAP(UNC onyen) to get into OMERO
     - Groups in OMERO are *not* linked/synced from LDAP at UNC
       - But they could, given the correct permissions/configuration
     - Could OMERO know/pass that along to iRODS?
 - OMERO has 'symlink'-in-place option when loading data
 - Need to provide docker-compose project that sets up a couple of these services
   - To test the permissions/sharing discussion above
 - Michelle scenario
   - Data acquired, dropped into a server, then 'ingested' into iRODS
   - Tagged as 'microscopy', and perhaps 'ready for omero'
   - OMERO can then see it
   - iRODS would 'take over' the in-place registration from OMERO
   - Consider OMERO has no write permissions, read-only via NFSRODS
 - Josh
   - Files loaded in OMERO, then iRODS is informed...
   - Then iRODS/script steals the files out from under OMERO (aka symlinks)
 - Terrell
   - What if ... there is no file sync... we just get files upon demand (via Python/Java)
   - But OMERO doesn't have a VFS (virtual filesystem layer/abstraction)
   - Maybe NFSRODS is the wrong level - too low level
 - What if single OMERO user - no multiuser
   - No existing visibility into who did what on the iRODS side
   - But could be mitigated with extensive/consistent/thorough metadata
   - Depends on the questions you'd like to answer later / reporting
   - There could be a contract/agreement/understanding that OMERO assumes ownership based on the iRODS namespace information
 - Mike
   - This sounds more like an OMERO ‘synch’ agent that needs to query OMERO as ingest/synch happens to derive metadata values? Am I misreading this?
   - Either from LDAP, or OMERO, or iRODS
     - Something has to be 'in charge', the source of truth
   - A sync agent that sits between OMERO and iRODS, speaks to both
     - Can move files, query things, make assertions, annotate in either system
     - Files in iRODS, tells NFSRODS, shows up for OMERO
     - Files/annotation show up in OMERO, written as omero, but then agent can execute policy to name them well (and tell OMERO it moved), change ownership, etc., similar to Utrecht/Yoda use case
   - This affords more policy driven by iRODS, communicated back to OMERO where appropriate (via events, or just more metadata?)
     - A fine carrot for increased interest/use by additional users / use cases
     - Provides confidence / bumpers for users as well
   - No need for OMERO- or iRODS-specific code in either place
     - Consolidates logic into single source of coordination
   - Sync agent will need to be admin / admin in both directions
   - Maybe just a docker application(!)
 - Next Meeting:
   - Mar 2022
