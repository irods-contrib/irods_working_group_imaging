## Minutes

 - Serialization of OMERO to iRODS via PRC
   - AA) Save (As)
     - Josh added target data object location for saving into iRODS namespace
       - No longer just named 'transfer.tar'
       - Leaves naming decision to the human
       - They have to know where they *can* save a datafile
       - Overwriting will happen today without first checking the target
       - What does error handling look like?  Bad path / bad permissions?
         - Josh - any errors will be shown in the OMERO UI
     - Currently hard-coded user/pass combo to talk to iRODS
       - OMERO *could* hold an annotation for username
       - But nowhere to get passwords at this time
         - OIDC would be favorite if possible
         - Only OMERO-web viable for now
           - Other clients don't know how to do this fancy web stuff (yet)
       - Inital work/success will just be 'service account'
         - Assume iRODS admins will handle the 'archive' side
       - Mapping file of usernames generated by admins
         - iRODS rodsadmin session can proxy as the correct user
       - Current OMERO LDAP integration uses OMERO email/username OR an LDAP query
         - mapping to iRODS could be similar, local or external
         - https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_6/html/username_map_file.html
   - BB) Load
     - Could/Should just be a flag on the same script to read/load?
     - Should it be able to overwrite *in* OMERO?
       - Would have to be a delete flag?  Maybe doesn't make sense.
       - Would always upload/create a new ID in OMERO
 - Looking for guinea pigs
   - If you'd like to archive OMERO information into elsewhere… this script provides a means to do that
   - Nirav - has a use case, NIH data management plans - if people ask for access to your data, this could provide a means to bundle a study to share with another OMERO user or elsewhere.  The storage system can be exposed for sharing without exposing the OMERO instance to others.
     - This is a vote for Save *and* Load
 - Joost - so this would not reuse the same ID in OMERO? … correct
   - What happens if OMERO data is deleted?
     - The archive/saved version is independent / decoupled
 - Alice - Dutch Bioimaging also interested in testing this
 - Guillaume - If you delete the raw-data in OMERO the annotations and thumbnails stay so you could have a way to keep a 'trace' of archived data (out of scope for this group)
 - Consortium
   - Check for overwrite/existence before sending/saving
   - Confirm errors are sent back to OMERO
   - Consider bidirectional save/load in the same script
   - Think about mapping file
     - What happens when no user found…
 - Next Meeting
   - March 2024
