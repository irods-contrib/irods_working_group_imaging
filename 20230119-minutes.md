## Minutes

 - Josh, working on story/ecosystem for zarr re: OME / OMERO
 - Global Bioimaging - 5 must havesâ€¦ for tomorrow's solution
   - https://globalbioimaging.org/ 
   - WG on Data Management, could use some iRODS participation
   - Maybe we're part of that story - 'for grown ups'
   - Whitepaper is the deliverable coming in 2023
 - 2023 meetings of interest
   - SciPy - July 10-16, 2023 https://www.scipy2023.scipy.org/ 
   - iRODS User Group Meeting, probably in NC, June, 13-16, 20-23, 27-30
   - ELMI - Netherlands - June 6-9 2023, a couple different sessions
 - Maastricht - perhaps DataHub can spin up a testing instance
   - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_imaging/tree/main/sandbox 
 - France Bioimaging - NFSRODS integration - working on permissions and integrations
   - working well enough today
   - Next steps
     - keycloak for OMERO and iRODS, for same LDAP information
     - User to do the inplace import needs to have permissions 'everywhere'
     - Sprint in february 6-10
   - Goal is to get images out of the facility 'as soon as possible'
   - Goal is also to have users see 'just files' in a regular way
     - UMass - users like to have a second backup somewhere (another vote for 'just files')
     - Lots of other iRODS clients as well https://irods.org/clients/ 
 - Inplace import is 'very safe' - OMERO checks a number of criteria
   - Could introduce a 'less safe' version of import that iRODS could use
     - Would give control to the 'agent' in the middle
   - iRODS side could have policy to handle the multiple users and permissions
     - BUT... goal is to have OMERO-specific code in the agent
     - Not on either OMERO or iRODS itself, keep the context in one place
 - Maastricht and NKI both interested in full -> working pipeline
   - 'big/full version' in iRODS, then policy-based conversion/downsample
   - big/full would/could be on tape
   - usable/visible versions available in OMERO
   - 'similar to the NGFF workflow' - generate a pyramid of images
     - knowledge of how to put them back together
 - NYU - seeing more dedicated professionals running instruments
   - then the core is only providing the product / images to users/requestors
   - more centralized / dependable process
   - but requires clean/specific instructions being conveyed from scientist to professional
     - a tough exercise
   - implication is that authorship is also given to the professional
 - Use Case - OMERO creates directory of images (of a certain format)
   - Agent knows enough about this - can 'swap out' a visible/finished version
   - Visible in OMERO
 - Next Meeting
   - Feb 16 2023
