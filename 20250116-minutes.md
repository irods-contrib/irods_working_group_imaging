## Minutes

 - NL Bioimaging
   - OMERO solution is being standardizedâ€¦ along with SURF
 - NKI Updates
   - In production with ManGO
   - Projects are starting
   - Splitting facility data from projects space
     - Raw (instrument) -> Working (projects) (with hardlinks?) -> archive
     - Raw tiers to archive
   - Hard links (read-only) in projects separately tier from separate iRODS resources
   - How to 'see' the data in OMERO or something else
   - iRODS as storage, with multiple interfaces, including OMERO/ManGO
   - ManGO OME Zarr integration discussion ongoing with Josh as well
 - OMERO integration
   - Potentially replacing ICE protocol for image access with OME Zarr
   - Leads to more straightforward way for iRODS to talk with OMERO itself
   - Josh at the train station with freezing hand and 1% battery
   - ManGO can already see OMEZarr files
   - Not interested in mapping all of OME model into the iRODS metadata
 - C++ 'synthetic' Python iRODS resource plugin
   - Looking into funding opportunities / partners for development
   - Pathology data / community also potentially interested
     - Formats and libraries already exist
   - BioIO?  Allen institute
 - (Virtual) Appliance / Recipe
   - Rather perhaps a Cookbook with consistent words and mental models
   - Because facilities may not have the bandwidth in/out of a lab
   - Hydrating/Dehydrating the data in place and 'at the bench'
     - Potentially 'iRODS'-ify the NGFF challenge
     - Success would be in/out to iRODS and then multiple clients/viewers
     - Next challenge OME2025 in Boston, end of April
       - Potential hackathon just after conference?
       - iRODS with access to two real buckets in two locations
       - Testing in/out via iRODS
 - Next Meeting
   - Feb 2025
