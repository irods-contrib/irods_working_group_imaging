## Minutes

 - Serialization of OMERO to (and from!) iRODS via PRC
   - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_imaging/pull/30/files 
   - Save/Export
     - Added overwrite protection
     - Confirmed Exceptions are logged by OMERO
     - Added as_user proxy to script
       - Need to use a mapping file instead
         - OMERO users -> iRODS users
   - Load/Import
     - Added transfer_from_irods
     - Don't know the OMERO call/syntax for writing, yet
   - AbsorbRawFile
     - Would have to go through the bioformats importerÂ®
       - parse/identify the file itself and header information
       - Haven't done this yet
     - Expect this to 'just work' for small files
       - Large files would take more temporary/staging space / impossible
 - Guillaume repository/project
   - https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/fbi-data/omero-quay 
   - Potentially launching soon
   - Syncing still in the pictures - NFSRODS
 - Testing
   - Tobias - irodsfs (fuse) mounted into the OMERO container
     - Easy to set up - but did not solve the use cases since there are still two databases tracking the file information
     - OMERO still has its own copy of the data (duplicate from what is in the iRODS logical paths)
 - Tobias - Question - regarding user mapping
   - why not have both systems use a similar database - do the matching in SQL
   - Ground truth is in LDAP and via shibboleth (the 'easy' case)
 - Tobias - working to store PIDs to allow external/agnostic LIMs systems

 - Next Meeting
