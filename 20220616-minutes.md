## Minutes

 - CZI EOSS
   - Submitted - Thank you all!
   - Awaiting response in Sept
 - European Light Microscopy Initiative (ELMI2022)
   - https://elmi2022.eu
   - Poster presented - thanks to impromptu PosterTeam on the ground
     - Marjolijn / Caterina / Josh / Camilo
   - Sending follow ups to new contacts
   - Josh: A need to describe the 'sync agent' use case to the imaging community
     - OMERO, half the audience have it, aware of it
     - iRODS, low awareness, 'hidden', however interestingly enough several people that are not already part of this Working Group raised hands when Josh asked for potential interest
     - Need to tell a story to 'Imaging' people
     - Make it real for their needs, acquisition/metadata/otherdata/etc
     - https://clowderframework.org/
   - Ken: Need some compelling example or story that showcases/explains how iRODS-OMERO works for biologists.
     - At the moment, it is a bit opaque.
     - Most of them donâ€™t seem to understand it (including me sometimes ;-)
     - Materials to managing upwards for getting biologists to want it...
 - iRODS User Group Meeting - July 5-8, Leuven, Belgium
   - Imaging Showcase / Discussion / BoF session
   - https://irods.org/ugm2022
   - Abstracts posted
   - Virtual option now available
 - iRODS and Zarr - small files
   - Optimized format for object storage (S3)
   - https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 
   - Lots of little files
   - iRODS has NetCDF library integration, maybe similar goal for Zarr
     - but 'opposite' b/c NetCDF is big file with tooling to see 'inside'
     - Zarr is lots of little files, need tooling to see it as a single unit
   - Perhaps standardizing on HDF5 backend (like NetCDF tooling)
 - Next Meeting
   - July 2022
