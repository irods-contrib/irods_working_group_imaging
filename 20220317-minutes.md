## Minutes

 - Latest plan...
   - A sync agent that sits between OMERO and iRODS, speaks to both
     - Will need to be admin / admin in both directions
   - Can move files, query things, make assertions, annotate in either system
   - Files in iRODS, tells NFSRODS, shows up for OMERO
   - Files/annotation show up in OMERO, written as omero, but then agent can execute policy to name them well (and tell OMERO it moved), change ownership, etc.
 - CZI EOSS
   - https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/ 
   - Letter of Intent Due April 19, 2022
   - Full Application Due June 2, 2022
   - Expected Awardee Start Date Nov 1, 2022
   - Josh - Zarr 2x, NGFF/Bioformats 1x, OMERO didn't (migration)
   - Caterina - one notfunded before, also applying this time
     - Thinks this is good candidate / idea
     - Suggest use cases with links to existing work/needs
   - John Constable - CZI funds cell atlas work at Sanger
   - Not just imaging, this is bigger - open science, integration with other / additional data / domains
   - Possible meeting with CZI program officer before LOI, Michelle can ask
   - Meeting need for mitigating solution for concerns with several private clouds storage
     - Sanger (Josh) - Human Cell Atlas (embryo data)
     - 4DN (Caterina) - https://www.4dnucleome.org/ 
     - UMMS - PMM (Caterina) - Small department that would be interested in using iRODS vs. OMERO and has no solutions yet (but several faculty are randomly using AWS for storing data)
 - OMERO/iRODS panel at ABRF in Palm Springs, CA
   - March 30, 11a PT
   - https://www.abrf.org/abrf-annual-meeting 
 - Caterina - chance to present at European Light Microscopy Initiative (ELMI)
   - June 7-10, 2022
   - https://elmi2022.eu 
   - Turku, Finland and Virtual
   - June 7th Core facility day
     - Session on Data Management
     - 15min talk?
     - Caterina, Josh, Terrell, Marjolijn, others?
     - iRODS / OMERO / Yoda, demonstrate an ingest/annotate/lifecycle
 - Valeria - new research requirements from NIH, Jan2023
   - Single cell spatial technologies
   - Companies assuming cloud companies to do the analysis
   - Concern is that research data is no longer 'on site'
   - iRODS could help/orchestrate these locations / analysis
   - Another CZI application?
   - Cross-discipline communication and sharing is biggest challenge
   - Technologies are moving very fast
 - Ingrid
   - iRODS User Group Meeting - July 5-8, Leuven, Belgium
   - Imaging Showcase / Discussion / BoF session
   - https://irods.org/ugm2022 
 - Josh - anyone else bridging both sides of this imaging and viz and storage and sharing?
 - Next Meeting
   - April 2022
