## Minutes

 - Java FileSystemProvider class to talk to iRODS
   - Can we do it 'quick'?  Yes.  Just need an MVP to test.
     - Probably most maintainable approach
     - Loose goal / investigation before UGM
   - Similar to PyFileSystem
   - Zarr format designed for fast / broad systems
     - Latency is a killer
     - Designed for tiling interfaces
     - Best when cached locally, but usually unrealistic (too big)

       - Zarr itself is just https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk/idr/zarr/v0.1/4495402.zarr

     - This would be separate interest/effort from 'just using iRODS S3 API' to share/expose the data?
       - Test 1 - just use iRODS S3 API?
         - We'll make a sandbox_s3
         - Automated deployment might use irods_testing_environment, without S3 API
         - irods_demo stands up S3 API
         - Requirements - Working topology, talking to existing 'real' s3 bucket, and OMERO, S3 API
           - User - import image, perhaps convert to zarr, save to iRODS, then omero can see the iRODS image via s3
             - Drop data into colleciton in iRODS, iRODS converts to OME-Zarr, import XML to OMERO, register S3 API with OMERO (S3 API only provides keypair access)
       - Test 2 - write FileSystemProvider and then any java application can talk directly to iRODS protocol
   - If we limit assumptions to the zarr universeâ€¦
     - Is there a driver/pressure to build FileSystemProvider?
   - Trends in Microscopy - every 2 years
     - Using Bruker HIVE, on-premises OMERO
 - ResearchSpace
   - Currently using 'basic' integration to iRODS, just stat/read/write files
 - NSF Proposal
   - Metadata templates - submitted
 - Lab Cookbook
   - Dehydrate/Rehydrate in/out with iRODS
   - Success would be in/out to iRODS and then multiple clients/viewers
   - Next challenge OME2025 in Boston, end of April
     - Potential hackathon just after conference? On Friday at Broad
     - iRODS with access to two real buckets in two locations
     - Testing in/out via iRODS
     - RENCI cannot travel without outside funding
 - Next Meeting
   - May 2025
