## Minutes

 - NKI
   - Using ManGO in production
   - Now working on backup again
   - Interested in ManGO image files 'import' into OMERO
   - Interested in 'Save' from OMERO to iRODS
   - Have 'archive' and 'working copy'
     - Will monitor usage / demand from users
     - Think about defining 80% workflows
     - Willing to test soon
 - Leiden is 'OMERO first' -> today... so 'save' is most similar to today's workflow
   - Interested in 'datastore first', as more forever/future solution

 - OMERO integration
   - No movement on import/roundtrips
   - Considering Java direct to iRODS
     - Probably too much work
     - Would drift / hard to keep synced/coordinated across projects
 - C++ 'synthetic' Python iRODS resource plugin
   - Can load python module to do the 24 required operations
   - Initial investigation - seems reasonable
   - Looking into funding opportunities / partners for development
   - To be shared with image.sc community for implementation ideas
 - (Virtual) Appliance / Recipe
   - Still need more lab / core insights and use cases
   - Define 'data products'
   - Have to have a place to write it down 'forever'
     - Or until policy says it can be deleted
