## Minutes

 - Updated image (v2)
 - Terrell/Josh met in December
   - Users will probably want to have OMERO use the iRODS storage
   - First use case - user script to 'fire' the Python to talk/register with iRODS
   - Next step, getting docker container with NFSRODS and iRODS running
     - Point OMERO at that NFS mountpoint
   - If anyone has both OMERO and iRODS already, we'd love to talk with you
   - Sanger has both, OMERO is hosted, but perhaps with on-premise storage
   - Paul van Schayck and Rodrigo Rosas (Maastricht University) have Omero and iRODS and are interested.  
 - NGFF next meeting end of January
   - https://forum.image.sc/t/next-call-on-next-gen-bioimaging-data-tools-2022-01-27/60885/5 
   - Goal is feature parity with OME-TIFF
   - Next version to include scale information in the fileformat itself
 - OMERO/iRODS panel at ABRF in Palm Springs, CA, end of March
   - March 30, 11a PT
   - https://www.abrf.org/abrf-annual-meeting 
 - Workflows
   - Assuming data is visible in OMERO, either in iRODS or not (this might be very key to decide/understand/explore)
   - Creating new images, or portions/duplicates, or annotating, permissions change
   - Adding new analysis files
   - Want some to be saved, but others… not… want the user to be in charge of 'saving' to iRODS when they want, rather than ALL iterative work.
 - OMERO does not currently track user access/durations, so getting visibility into this via iRODS rules/auditing would be helpful/useful
   - Would require multi-user, rather than single OMERO proxy/admin user.
   - OS-level, single OMERO user on disk/ownership - would be tricky to separate that at the NFSRODS connection level
 - What is metadata?
   - Main data is the image… additional analysis is the metadata?
   - How do we determine / manage this distinction?
 - Next Meeting:
   - Feb 2022
