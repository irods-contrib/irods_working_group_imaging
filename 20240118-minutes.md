## Minutes

 - Serialization of OMERO format to iRODS via PRC
   - No NFSRODS
   - AA) 'Save' is working, two commits in PR
     - Python script, uploaded to OMERO, executed with Image payload
     - https://github.com/irods-contrib/irods_working_group_imaging/pull/30
     - Saves a new data object into iRODS, currently always named 'transfer.tar'
     - DEMO
     - Have to decide where in the iRODS namespace to drop these data objects - just pass a 'full path'?  But that requires an OMERO user to 'know' where they want it to go in iRODS (iRODS knowledge).  Could be derived/generated from the 'open' files in OMERO.
     - Have to determine naming structure for data object (timestamp?  Username?  User gets to pass a string for the named file?  Concatenation of all of these?)
     - Mapping of OMERO user to iRODS users and permissions and passwords
       - No place to store secrets, currently OMERO user info is just hashed passwords in OMERO db or in LDAP
       - When in a browser, can just OAuth/OIDC everywhere else needed
       - COULD just be that OMERO is always just a service account (a single irods user), and attach a payload/instructions for some policy on the iRODS side to open/parse/takeaction
         - Simpler, no additional code on the OMERO side
         - Complex, more code on the iRODS side
     - Scripts not currently interactive with the user - so cannot prompt the human for credentials
     - Want to make sure no overwriting existing data in iRODS
     - No delay/async mechanism in OMERO proper
       - Past users have done async operations 'out of band'
       - Would just do the same here, pushing to subprocess
   - BB) Load - Read snapshot from iRODS into active OMERO object
     - Would create a new instance, could overwrite something in OMERO, TBD
   - CC) List - shows the existing snapshots in the iRODS side
 - Transfer Tool TODO
   - On OMERO side, tar gets created, then gets pushed…
   - Should be possible, to NOT copy… possibly using libarchive(.c)?
   - Plan for long-term support for archives.
 - Do we need to support more than one iRODS Zone?
   - I think this is 'solved' by the user abstraction layer on the OMERO side
   - Will need a secure place in the OMERO server OR a mapping/pointer into an already secure area
 - Next time - research
   - How does Bisque interconnect work?  Users?  Secrets?  Memory footprint?  Async?
 - France Bioimaging
   - Still working on the sync using NFSRODS
   - https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/fbi-data/omero-quay/-/tree/dev?ref_type=heads 
   - Passing around schemas via zeroMQ with the truth, and then each side is responsible for making that truth, actually true. Latest timestamp wins in either direction.
   - Proof of concepts getting deployed next week
 - Next Meeting
   - Feb 2024
