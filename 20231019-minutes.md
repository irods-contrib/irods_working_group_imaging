## Minutes

 - Serialization of OMERO format to iRODS via PRC
   - OMERO separate from iRODS - no NFSRODS
   - AA) Save - Just python script, as button in OMERO - 'Save As' / 'Snapshot'
     - An .omero file? Or .omero-snapshot?
   - BB) Load - Read snapshot from iRODS into active OMERO object
   - No progress - Josh Moore out sick
 - Ander scenario - Open OMERO, pick files from somewhereâ€¦ 
   - Could be local OR iRODS
   - Can use existing datastores
   - Allows for computers to see the formats, internal structures
     - Easier to integrate later, b/c not tied to user interactions (messy)
   - OMERO possible consortium?
 - Need an OMERO demo next time!
 - Next Meeting
   - b/c Supercomputing and Holidays...
   - Perhaps January 2024
